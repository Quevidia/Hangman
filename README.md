# Hangman
A simplistic Hangman game made in C#, using .NET 5.0 :)

# How to compile:

Open up Visual Studio (preferably Visual Studio 2019) and then proceed to right click your solution in the solution explorer, then select build. It's that simple haha. Just keep in mind that you will also need .NET 5.0 installed :)

# How to play:

You will want to launch the executable (assuming that you have it compiled already). Since this is a console application, a console should appear on your PC. You should be given a bunch of blanked-out characters, and your task is to choose any letter on your keyboard to fill in the blanks. You will only have 7 chances, so take precautions!
